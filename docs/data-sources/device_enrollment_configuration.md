# microsoft365wp_device_enrollment_configuration (Data Source)

The Base Class of Device Enrollment Configuration / https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-deviceenrollmentconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta

## Provider Notes

### Default Enrollment Configurations
To target _default_ enrollment configurations instead of creating new ones, `display_name` **must** be set to
`###TfWorkplaceDefault###` and `priority` **must** be set to `0`. `description`, `role_scope_tag_ids` and
`assignments` should not be set (their values will be ignored).  
The provider will then automatically import the existing default config from MS Graph on resource creation
instead of creating a new MS Graph entity. On destruction, the provider will only remove the resource from
Terraform state but not try to delete the default config entity from MS Graph.  
To compare your own Terraform config to the actual values of a default configuration in MS Graph, you can still
import the entity into Terraform state as can be done with any other resource (e.g.
`terraform import microsoft365wp_device_enrollment_configuration.windows_hello_for_business_default 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef_DefaultWindowsHelloForBusiness` -
get the real `id` directly from MS Graph using e.g. some browser's development tools). Then run `terraform plan` as
usual to see the required changes.  

### Priorities
MS Graph seems to be quite picky about setting priorities. They have to be sequential (i.e. there cannot be gaps
when creating) and when updating priorities, values can only be switched with another exiting config (e.g. if
the config with priority 1 gets deleted (e.g. manually) then the list will start with priority 2 and the
`setPriority` action will refuse to set any other config to priority 1 anymore but only to priority 2).  
Therefore setting of configuration priorities has been implemented as best-effort only: Any errors returned from
MS Graph during the `setPriority` action will only be shown as warnings in Terraform and more than one apply
action may be required to actually get every priority set correctly.  
And in case of a situation that MS Graph is not willing (or able) to fulfill, there will continously remain
changes. If you are really, really sure that your configuration should actually be fulfillable by MS Graph, then
it may help to destroy all configurations again and start over.  

### Delays Between Writes
As there have been situations during testing that resulted in multiple enrollment configurations with duplicate
priority values (which MS Graph was unable to correct or reorder ever again), all write operations will incur a
small delay to ensure individual priority values.

## Documentation Disclaimer

Please note that almost all information on this page has been sourced literally from the official Microsoft Graph API 
documentation and therefore is governed by Microsoft and not by the publishers of this provider.  
All supplements authored by the publishers of this provider have been explicitly marked as such.

## Query Filters (if Supported)

If filtering by attribute values is supported (see schema below), then values set by the practitioner inside the config 
will be translated to a respective OData `$filter` clause. For string attributes (except enumerations!), simple 
wildcards (`*`) are supported at the start and/or the end of the attribute value or else exactly once inside and will be 
translated to corresponding OData predicates and functions (i.e. `eq`, `startswith`, `endswith` and `contains`). 
Multiple filter clauses will be combined using ` and `.  
If supported (see schema below), the attributes `odata_filter`, `odata_orderby` and `odata_top` can also be used to 
provide literal values for the respective OData options.

If this is a data source that returns a single element (singular data source), then the resulting OData query must 
result in exactly one returned entity! If supported, `odata_top = 1` and `odata_orderby` may be used to select a single 
entity from a list.

Please note that in the end all OData clauses/options will have to be interpreted by MS Graph, so MS Graph might impose 
further restrictions on what functionality may be used in practice.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    microsoft365wp = {
      source = "terraprovider/microsoft365wp"
    }
  }
}

/*
.env
export ARM_TENANT_ID='...'
export ARM_CLIENT_ID='...'
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
*/


data "microsoft365wp_device_enrollment_configuration" "one" {
  id = "d186b27b-2a2f-44f0-920e-6fddd22ba192_Windows10EnrollmentCompletionPageConfiguration"
}

output "microsoft365wp_device_enrollment_configuration" {
  value = data.microsoft365wp_device_enrollment_configuration.one
}
```
