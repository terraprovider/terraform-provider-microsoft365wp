# microsoft365wp_device_configurations_custom (Data Source)

Device Configuration. / https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta

Provider Note: When using values of type `base64`, `string` or `string_xml` the write permission `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` is required also for plan operations. This is due to the fact that values of these types are saved encrypted in MS Graph and need to be retrieved using the special MS Graph action `getOmaSettingPlainTextValue` (which requires write permissions) when reading. Also see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/intune-deviceconfig-deviceconfiguration-getomasettingplaintextvalue
