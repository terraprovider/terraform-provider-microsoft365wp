# microsoft365wp_mobile_app (Data Source)

An abstract class containing the base properties for Intune mobile apps. / https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-mobileapp?view=graph-rest-beta

Provider Note: There have been reports about OpenTofu crashing (with a panic) when trying to generate configuration using `-generate-config-out=...`. Unfortunately this happens inside the code of OpenTofu itself and is not easily diagnoseable from outside or changeable from the provider. A workaround might be to instead use Terraform for generating the config (as it seems to work well for it) - the result should be fully compatible and usable also with OpenTofu.
