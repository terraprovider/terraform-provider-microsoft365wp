# microsoft365wp_cross_tenant_access_policy_configuration_partner (Resource)

Represents the partner-specific configuration for cross-tenant access and tenant restrictions. Cross-tenant access settings include inbound and outbound settings of Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration and B2B direct connect.

For any partner-specific property that is `null`, these settings inherit the behavior configured in your [default cross-tenant access settings](../resources/crosstenantaccesspolicyconfigurationdefault.md). / https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/crosstenantaccesspolicyconfigurationpartner?view=graph-rest-beta
