### Nested Schema for `email_settings`

Optional:

- `sender_domain` (String) Specifies the [domain](domain.md) that should be used when sending email notifications. This domain must be [verified](../api/domain-verify.md) in order to be used. We recommend that you use a domain that has the appropriate DNS records to facilitate email validation, like SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MX, because this then complies with the [RFC compliance](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt) for sending and receiving email. For details, see [Learn more about Exchange Online Email Routing](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/mail-flow-best-practices). The _provider_ default value is `"microsoft.com"`.
- `use_company_branding` (Boolean) Specifies if the organization’s banner logo should be included in email notifications. The banner logo will replace the Microsoft logo at the top of the email notification. If `true` the banner logo will be taken from the tenant’s [branding settings](organizationalbranding.md). This value can only be set to `true` if the [organizationalBranding](organizationalbranding.md) **bannerLogo** property is set. The _provider_ default value is `false`.
