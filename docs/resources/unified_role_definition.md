## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name for the unifiedRoleDefinition. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`. Required.  Supports `$filter` (`eq` and `startsWith`).
- `is_enabled` (Boolean) Flag indicating if the role is enabled for assignment. If false the role is not available for assignment. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`.
- `role_permissions` (Attributes Set) List of permissions included in the role. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`. Required. / Represents a collection of allowed resource actions and the conditions that must be met for the action to be effective. Resource actions are tasks that can be performed on a resource. For example, the application resource supports create, update, delete, and reset password resource actions. / https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/unifiedrolepermission?view=graph-rest-beta (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--role_permissions))

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description for the unifiedRoleDefinition. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`.
- `is_privileged` (Boolean) Flag indicating if the role is privileged. Microsoft Entra ID defines a role as privileged if it contains at least one sensitive resource action in the **rolePermissions** and **allowedResourceActions** objects. Applies only for actions in the `microsoft.directory` resource namespace. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). The _provider_ default value is `false`.
- `template_id` (String) Custom template identifier that can be set when isBuiltIn is `false`. This identifier is typically used if one needs an identifier to be the same across different directories. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`.

### Read-Only

- `allowed_principal_types` (String) Types of principals that can be assigned the role. Read-only. The This is a multi-valued enumeration that can contain up to three values as a comma-separated string. For example, `user, group`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). / Possible values are: `user`, `servicePrincipal`, `group`, `unknownFutureValue`
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the unifiedRoleDefinition. Key, not nullable, Read-only.  Supports `$filter` (`eq` operator only).
- `inherits_permissions_from` (Attributes Set) Read-only collection of role definitions that the given role definition inherits from. Only Microsoft Entra built-in roles support this attribute. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inherits_permissions_from))
- `is_built_in` (Boolean) Flag indicating if the unifiedRoleDefinition is part of the default set included with the product or custom. Read-only.  Supports `$filter` (`eq`).
- `version` (String) Indicates the version of the unifiedRoleDefinition object. Read-only when **isBuiltIn** is `true`.
