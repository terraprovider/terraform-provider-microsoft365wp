Each shared license purchased can enable up to three Cloud PCs, with only one user signed in at a time. The `sharedByEntraGroup` plan also requires the purchase of a shared service plan. Each shared license under this plan can enable one Cloud PC, which is shared for the group according to the assignments of this policy.
